Steps to run project

Runnable Jar:

I have created runnable jar file and please find the attached same. However, when i try to execute file in cmd prompt with below commands, I am seeing "glue" file path
has some issues and "MainPageGlue" has failed instantiate. Trying to debug it but no luck till now. 

I will try to fix this issue before the Assignment interview.

java -jar automation_1.jar classpath:features/scenario.feature --glue classpath:glue

Steps to run standalone project
i) git path:
I have placed the project in below git hub path.
https://github.com/siva201518/automation_1.git

ii) Create one folder in desktop (for example name- Automation)
Right click->git bash here-> in cmd prompt, type "git init"
then, type "git clone https://github.com/siva201518/automation_1.git"
The project will get cloned to this path.

iii) In IntelliJ/Eclipse: File->Open->Open File or Project- > Select Automation folder (desktop) path and select "Pom.xml".
Open it as project.
iv) In Intellij/Eclipse ->Terminal-> Type "mvn clean install".
Project along with dependencies will get created automatically.

v) Navigate to "src/main/java/TestRunner" (For creating runnable jar, I have placed the "TestRunner" in Main folder).
Ideally, it should be in Test Folder.
Right click on TestRunner and select "Run as TestRunner".
vi) Scenarios in feature files will get executed and cucumber reports genereated in "target->cucumber->cucumber-html-reports->
report-feature_****(numbers).html".
 Right click on ths file -> Open in->Browser->Chrome. The cucumber reports will open up in chrome browser.

I have attached the sample cucumber report generated.
